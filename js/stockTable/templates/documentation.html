	This application analyzes the attractiveness of stocks based on the opinions of industry analysts. It takes a stock's 1 year expected price, calculates a <a href="#coe">discount rate</a> using the stock's <a href="#beta">beta</a> and the <a href"#capm">Capital Asset Pricing Model</a>, and determines an individual share's <a href="#npv">net present value</a>. With this, the application calculates the stock's <a href="#roi">return on investment</a>, which it compares to other stocks.

<div id="documentation-body">
	<div id="roi" class="documentation-label">
		Return on Investment (ROI)
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		A normalized way to compare stocks of different prices to each other, regardless of price. This measure takes the expected return and risk of the company into consideration.
		
		<div class="equation">
			ROI = <a href="#npv">NPV</a> / Stock price
		</div>

	<div id="irr" class="documentation-label">
		Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		The effective rate a stock is expected to get. This is the <a href="#coe">discount rate</a> that a stock would need in order to obtain an <a href="#npv">NPV</a> of $0. The main difference between IRR and <a href="#roi">ROI</a> is that <a href="#roi">ROI</a> takes risk into account, but IRR does not.
		
		<div class="equation">
			IRR = (1 year target price + dividends) / current price

	<div id="npv" class="documentation-label">
		Net Present Value (NPV)
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		A numerical way to measure the attractiveness of an investment, or in this case, a stock. NPV is a fundamental valuation technique used in finance. NPV measures cash flows, taking the <a href="#tvm">time value of money</a> into account. Here, a simplified, one year model is used to calculate the NPV of each stock.
	
		<div class="equation">
			NPV = (1 year target price + dividends) / (1 + <a href="#coe">COE</a>)

	<div id="coe" class="documentation-label">
		Cost of Equity (COE), or Discount Rate
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		A numerical measure of risk of a stock. The higher the COE, the higher the risk of the stock. A stock that performs similarly to the market will normally have a COE of between 10% and 12%. COE is calculated using the <a href"#capm">CAPM</a>.

	<div id="capm" class="documentation-label">
		Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		Used to calculate the <a href="#coe">COE</a> of a stock. CAPM uses the risk of the company, as measured by the <a href="#beta">beta</a>, and the <a href="#market-risk-premium">market risk premium</a> to determine a <a href="#coe">discount rate</a> for the stock.

		Market Risk Premium
	</div>
	<div class="documentation-text">
		An investor will not want to take on extra risk unless they expect a higher rate of return. The market risk premium is the difference between the <a href="#market-rate">market's expected return</a> and the <a href="#risk-free-rate">risk free rate of return</a>.
